### Introduction

This page contains all the files and information to use the Bear X axis with the original [E3D Hemera](https://e3d-online.com/e3d-hemera).

The Hemera needs a dedicated mount to be used with the Bear X axis. All hardware and printed parts needed are available in the [Bill of Materials](#bill-of-materials) section below.

Note: The BearMera reduces a little the print surface to 205x240mm (compared to 210x250mm for Original Prusa).

### Compatibility

The BearMera has a smaller print surface compared to the Original Prusa, Bear and Bondtech extruders: 205x240mm for BearMera, 210x250mm for Bear extruder.

The BearMera is compatible with Original Prusa as well as Bear frame. You must use the Bear X axis in both cases.

This BearMera is only compatible with the Bear X axis.

This BearMera is **NOT** compatible with the original Prusa X axis.

You will need to replace **all** printed parts if you are already using the Bear X axis (with another extruder) of version **equal or smaller than 0.7.0-beta**.

#### Hardware BOM for Original Prusa printers

This is the list of extra material you will need from original Prusa extruder and X axis.

Note<sup>1</sup>: The nozzle_fan_duct needs to be printed with a heat resistant filament like ABS, Extrudr GreenTec Pro, annealed HTPLA, PC and probably much more. Don't forget to compensate for shrinkage accordingly to the filament type you are using.

You can find more details about recommended filaments in on our [FAQ](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Wiki/Bear_FAQ).
